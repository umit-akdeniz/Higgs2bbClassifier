# Higgs2bbClassifier

A robust machine learning pipeline for classifying Higgs boson decays into bottom quark pairs (H→bb̄) using CERN Open Data.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The objective of this project is to develop a reliable binary classifier that can distinguish signal events corresponding to Higgs boson decays into bottom quark-antiquark pairs (H→bb̄) from background noise. The data is sourced from CERN's open dataset and processed using modern data science techniques including:

- Data preprocessing & cleansing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Experiment configuration and reproducibility
